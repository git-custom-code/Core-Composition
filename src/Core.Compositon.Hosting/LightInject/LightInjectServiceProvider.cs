/*********************************************************************************

    This is a slightly modified copy of Bernhard Richter's light inject
    dependency injection repository, since at the time of creating this
    code, said repo was a) not signed and b) had no support for the new
    .Net core generic host.
    Once those two features are implemented by the author, this copy
    can be safely removed.
